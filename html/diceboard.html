                    The DB2021 came to me in a vision(no joke) after making a redox handwired keyboard, I had extra parts left over for potentially making  a macropad from scratch.
                    While thinking of what to even do with a macropad, I came across a device someone made call a decision <a href= "https://www.instructables.com/Dry-Erase-Decision-Wheel/">wheel</a>.
                    I thought, "that's funny I usually roll dice to help make decisions...". There it was, a mini-keyboard that rolls dice.

                <p class= "text-center">
                     After making a handwired mechanical keyboard, I had left over kailh box jade key switches and blank keycaps. I used arduino pro micros to in the keyboard build so I had a couple of those lying around. What I needed was an enclosure and a display.
                     I printed a macropad enclosure found on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4497991">thingiverse</a> and bought a cheap I2c OLED display from amazon. The liPo battery and keyswitch came later.

                    The build began by placing the keyswitches into the 3D-printed keyplate. I decided to not do a diode matrix and instead treat each key as a unique digital input. To do this I soldered a wire to one pin of each key, then connected them all with wire for grounding.
                    <img src="/img/Diceboard/wired.jpg" class="d-block w-100 img-fluid p-5" alt=""> It was a good start. Wiring the display was a lot easier than I was expecting. It has 4 pins, one for ground, one for power, and two data pins. After everything was assembled it was time to write some code and do some testing.

                    I'm pretty new to Arduino, so writing the code for this was a challenge initially, but luckily I have enough familiarity with C++ (which arduino is based on) to get by. I started by figuring out the display. I had to learn how to use libraries for specific hardware to write arduino code for it. Pretty neat.
                    I ran some various test using demo code to get the arduino to display. After the display worked, I wrote some simple test code to get the display custom messages. The next step was to write button inputs then a function for the dice rolls. Check out the code below:

                    Now that the board worked I decided it would be nice to make it portable. I then did some research to figure out how to attach a battery. I originally had a 9v battery plugged in,
                    <img src="/img/Diceboard/preboard.jpg" class="d-block w-100 img-fluid p-5" alt=""> 
                    but it was a bit cumbersome and had no way of switching it off and on. I found a rechargable liPo battery that would work fine with 
                    a pro micro and found a way to connect a power switch. It needed a new enclosure. At the time I had been working on the <a href="/html/cyberdeck.html">Cyberdeck</a>, while doing so I was experimenting with custom 3d printed altoid tins. A slightly upscaled version of one
                    seemed like a good fit for the diceboard. I found some relegendable keycaps on amazon, printed some dice icons and placed them accordingly. Into the new enclosure it went along with its new power source. Aesthetically it looks like a slapped together peice of junk...just the way I like it.
