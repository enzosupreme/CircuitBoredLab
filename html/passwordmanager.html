                    This project is a gift idea for my Mom. She is starting to get overwhelmed with keeping track of her passwords. After seeing Adafruit's macropad kit and <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-2fa-totp-authentication-friend">2fa keypad</a> project.
                    I thought "why not simplify this and make a password manager?" I thought it would be a fun challenge that would help me get my feet wet with Circuit Python.

                <h1 class="text-warning text-left">Stage 1: Planning and Prep</h1>
                <p class= "text-center">
                     Getting the parts was actually, as Bob Ross would put it, a "happy accident". By the time I decided on buying the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5128">macropad kit</a> it was out of stock, so I considered building one. 
                     While researching parts, my adabox arrived, a subscription box from adafruit that ships a kit every month(I know it sounds like I'm shilling for adafruit, but they have nice stuff). To my surprise the box was comprised by the very kit
                     I needed to build this gift.

                <p style="text-indent:40px" class= "text-center"></p>
                    The kit consisted of a nice braided pink usb c cable, 12 kailh red linear mechanical key switches, 12 clear keycaps, a macropad devboard with oled display and rotary encoder pre-installed. Each key slot is dawned with an rgb led. It was a completely solderless kit
                    and was a breeze to put together.

                    Now the fun part was learning how to macgyver together some Circuit Python. After downloading Circuit Python it took me a while to learn how to actually load code onto the board. The board requires you to boot into a type of bootloader mode that will allow you to drag and drop a firmware file,
                    after the firmware is loaded you can modify a file called "code.py". The experience greatly differs than coding in the arduino environment, but after some time with I think I enjoy this method. After tinkering with various demo code examples and getting a feel of how I could approach this project,
                    I got to work. I was able to come up with a simple way to store and send plain text as well as other keystrokes. I then played around with some rgb color schemes then found a way to display images. I did get it to display monochrome logos as a way of indicating what passwords are being entered,
                    but ultimately decided against it. A text based approached felt/looked right. You can get the code here:

                     </p>

              <h1 class="text-warning text-left">Stage 4: Features</h1>
                <p style="text-indent:40px" class= "text-center"></p>
                    <!--<img src="/img/BatSignal/PXL_20210726_233530982.jpg" class="img-fluid md-5" alt="">-->
                    The keys light up a sort of neon light green and remain on. They change to red after a keystroke for about 1-2 milliseconds before returning to default. I programmed the rotary encoder switch to turn the leds off when desired. While playing with the rotary encoder,
                    it made sense to add volume controls as well. For the display, it displays what account you're logging into and a password successful message. The keys only send a pre-stored plain text string. Nothing fancy, the display is mainly for show but a nice visual confirmation nontheless.
                    I plan on on changing the keycaps with relegendable keycaps to add logos of the log ins, but I'll give her the gift before it is fully customized.
